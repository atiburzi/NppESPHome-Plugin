# NppESPHome-Plugin
A Notepad++ plugin written in Delphi to directly interact with ESPHome and manage related projects in Windows environment.

After discovering the potential of ESPHome, I started working on several projects and immediately ran into the lack of a tool that would help me speed up the development workflow, including writing YAML code and performing related testing.
Despite the power of the command line provided by both Python and ESPHome itself, I needed something that would save me from repeatedly rewriting the same commands, even if they were very simple.

At first, I developed a Windows application that acted as a wrapper, but I soon realized that by relying exclusively on Notepad++ for code editing, I could create a plugin that would make interaction with ESPHome commands immediate and straightforward.

Thatâ€™s how the idea for this plugin was born.
